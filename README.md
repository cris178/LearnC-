#Learn C#

A tutorial for absolute beginners in programming. This is not meant to replace a traditional study from a university. This will not teach you how to become the best programmer nor the best practices for using C#. This is just an introduction for those curious about programming and is produced every other week for the gaming news site TICGN.com. 

Again, do not assume you will receive the best education from these tutorials. They are just excercises to get your foot wet and see whether or not you'll love programming. It does not dwelve heavily on any mathmatics and as stated before is just meant to attract potential students of computer science.
